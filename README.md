# Demos
 Description and examples of interesting numerical methods.
 
 This repo is intended to serve as friendly reminder of how to use some methods for integrating Differential Equations and other mathematical tools, with explanation and visual examples for future use.
 
 I commit to add more practical solutions and a growing pool of dummy and real problems, mainly using Python libraries, be it the usual Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy triad or others.
 
 Here, an updated list of stuff I'm writing.

 It is necessary to mention two important facts: <b>1st</b> although I've known Python por almost a decade, I'm always learning new stuff, discovering new libraries, improving my coding skills and arguing with myself on whether to keep changing an algorithm or leave it alone; at some point I guess one is confident enough to declare a job well done, but for me it's still a 'well done, but it could be better'.
 
 <b>2nd</b> addressing the methods, when one searches numerical solutions for analytically expensive problems, it is always, <b>always</b> a good starting point to determine if it is even worth the time and effort. How? Studying the existence and uniqueness of the solution being searched. That's when good ol' Maths come in play. These methods can't tell you if you are in good position to even use them, so it is assumed that you are.
