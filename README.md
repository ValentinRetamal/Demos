# Demos
 Description and examples of interesting numerical methods.
 
 This repo is intended to serve as friendly reminder of how to use some methods for integrating Differential Equations and other mathematical tools, with explanation and visual examples for future use.
 
 I commit to add more practical solutions and a growing pool of dummy and real problems, mainly using Python libraries, be it the usual Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy triad or others.
 
 Here, an updated list of stuff I'm writing.

 <li>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</li>
 <li>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)</li>
